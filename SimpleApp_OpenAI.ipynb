language models (LLMs).\\nLangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:\\n\\nDevelopment: Build your applications using LangChain\\'s open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations.\\nUse LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.\\nProductionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.\\nDeployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\nConcretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:\\n\\nlangchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.\\nIntegration packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.\\nlangchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application\\'s cognitive architecture.\\nlangchain-community: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.\\nLangGraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.\\nLangGraphPlatform: Deploy LLM applications built with LangGraph to production.\\nLangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.\\n\\nnoteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library.
